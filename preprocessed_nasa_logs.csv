"['Cutright, Steve', 'Moore, James B.']",2017-02-07,2017-01-09,"Advancements in aircraft electric propulsion may enable an expanded operational envelope for electrically powered vehicles compared to their internal combustion engine counterparts. High aspect ratio wings provide additional lift and drag reduction for a proposed multi-propulsor design, however, the challenge is to reduce the weight of wing structures while maintaining adequate structural and aeroelastic margins. Design exploration using a conventional design-and-build philosophy coupled with a finite element method (FEM)-based design of experiments (DOE) strategy are presented to examine high aspect ratio wing structures that have spanwise distributed electric motors. Multiple leading-edge-mounted engine masses presented a challenge to design a wing within acceptable limits for dynamic and aeroelastic stability. Because the first four primary bending eigenmodes of the proposed wing structure are very sensitive to outboard motor placement, safety-of-flight requirements drove the need for multiple spars, rib attachments, and outboard structural reinforcements in the design. Global aeroelasticity became an increasingly important design constraint during the on-going design process, with outboard motor pod flutter ultimately becoming a primary design constraint. Designers successively generated models to examine stress, dynamics, and aeroelasticity concurrently. This research specifically addressed satisfying multi-disciplinary design criteria to generate fluid-structure interaction solution sets, and produced high aspect ratio primary structure designs for the NASA Scalable Convergent Electric Propulsion Technology and Operations Research (SCEPTOR) project in the Aeronautic Research Mission Directorate at NASA. In this paper, a dynamics-driven, quasi-inverse design methodology is presented to address aerodynamic performance goals and structural challenges encountered for the SCEPTOR demonstrator vehicle. These results are compared with a traditional computer aided design based approach.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001321', 'NF1676L-24765']","['2017 AIAA SciTech Forum; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001321'],['English'],['CASI'],['No Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Aircraft Propulsion and Power', 'Aircraft Design, Testing and Performance']","['STRUCTURAL DESIGN', 'FINITE ELEMENT METHOD', 'AERODYNAMIC CONFIGURATIONS', 'DESIGN ANALYSIS', 'MATHEMATICAL MODELS', 'AEROELASTICITY', 'AEROELASTIC RESEARCH WINGS', 'ELECTRIC PROPULSION', 'AIRCRAFT DESIGN', 'EXPERIMENT DESIGN', 'WINGS', 'ELECTRIC MOTORS', 'HIGH ASPECT RATIO', 'LEADING EDGES', 'FLUTTER', 'RIBS (SUPPORTS)', 'COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS', 'NASA PROGRAMS', 'LIFT', 'COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN']",['Structural Design Exploration of an Electric Powered Multi-Propulsor Wing Configuration'],['Conference Paper'],Unknown,Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.5801393728222997,0.07218127785944026,0.0,0.0,0.07670355425511434,0.0,0.0,0.22764782746053286,0.062411519032065765,0.11015273634285883,0.0,0.046290641087263856,0.10926846562253772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12717425461791795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.722634440994129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750305179746706,0.0,0.07396692353066903,0.05919405475280398,0.0,0.18110460750362697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062411519032065765,0.1690681503816967,0.11953911308272201,0.062210097272797915,0.0,0.0779921234446689,0.0,0.06896381358017846,0.0,0.06612580895460674,0.0,0.0,0.07051888151076172,0.0,0.09884859185085898,0.0,0.0,0.10117681220468128,0.04010492759490933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05152085158811716,0.06358712730895898,0.0,0.20689144074053537,0.0,0.07589556778198121,0.16390269843380662,0.046290641087263856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06612580895460674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03835177712755717,0.24807414979385004,0.07051888151076172,0.053817368481584485,0.07586543956418325,0.0,0.0,0.2145320855292501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043518023720333504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896381358017846,0.0,0.10897733532204593

Motivated by Digital Twin, a structural health management (SHM) paradigm that integrates vehicle-specific characteristics with continual in-situ damage diagnosis and prognosis, the methods studied herein yield near real-time damage assessments that could enable monitoring of a vehicle's health while it is operating (i.e. online SHM). High-fidelity modeling and uncertainty quantification (UQ), both critical to Digital Twin, are incorporated using finite element method simulations and Bayesian inference, respectively. The crux of the proposed Bayesian diagnosis methods, however, is the reformulation of the numerical sampling algorithms (e.g. Markov chain Monte Carlo) used to generate the resulting probabilistic damage estimates. To this end, three distinct methods are demonstrated for rapid sampling that utilize surrogate modeling and exploit various degrees of parallelism for leveraging HPC. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the methods are compared on the problem of strain-based crack identification in thin plates. While each approach has inherent problem-specific strengths and weaknesses, all approaches are shown to provide accurate probabilistic damage diagnoses and several orders of magnitude computational speedup relative to a baseline Bayesian diagnosis implementation.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001319', 'NF1676L-24792']","['AIAA SciTech 2017; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001319'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Computer Programming and Software'],"['MONTE CARLO METHOD', 'DIAGNOSIS', 'FINITE ELEMENT METHOD', 'REAL TIME OPERATION', 'PERFORMANCE PREDICTION', 'MARKOV CHAINS', 'BAYES THEOREM', 'DAMAGE ASSESSMENT', 'DAMAGE', 'PROGNOSIS', 'SIMULATION']",['Near Real-Time Probabilistic Damage Diagnosis Using Surrogate Modeling and High Performance Computing'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Langley Research Center'],Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.42770034843205573,0.0,0.0856932564278027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25688232700402813,0.07922969646631865,0.18644780110533096,0.0,0.0,0.06935664680878934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07269685408107517,0.055244926956586456,0.0,0.0,0.08072209864441153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5641712181020879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072209864441153,0.09389896273589123,0.0,0.0,0.07663576266955884,0.0,0.0,0.07514521459196848,0.0,0.14308489249643755,0.0758757981882397,0.0789739971163268,0.07780673399344534,0.0,0.0,0.08754765309125133,0.3291642680508083,0.0,0.0,0.27489640489680456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22477203612852464,0.050912095866723225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072209864441153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19474607943441252,0.28343094199145663,0.0,0.0,0.09630907630794656,0.08229106701270207,0.0,0.23829972811239278,0.0,0.0,0.06449114777298665,0.055244926956586456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17509530618250266,0.0,0.04611457058558815

"['Castner, Raymond', 'McGowan, Anna-Maria', 'Bakula, Casey']",2017-02-07,2017-01-09,"In late 2015, NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) funded an experiment in rapid design and rapid teaming to explore new approaches to solving challenging design problems in aeronautics in an effort to cultivate and foster innovation. This report summarizes several lessons learned from the rapid design portion of the study. This effort entailed learning and applying design thinking, a human-centered design approach, to complete the conceptual design for an open-ended design challenge within six months. The design challenge focused on creating a capability to advance experimental testing of autonomous aeronautics systems, an area of great interest to NASA, the US government as a whole, and an entire ecosystem of users and developers around the globe. A team of nine civil servant researchers from three of NASA's aeronautics field centers with backgrounds in several disciplines was assembled and rapidly trained in design thinking under the guidance of the innovation and design firm IDEO. The design thinking process, while used extensively outside the aerospace industry, is less common and even counter to many practices within the aerospace industry. In this report, several contrasts between common aerospace research and development practices and design thinking are discussed, drawing upon the lessons learned from the NASA rapid design study. The lessons discussed included working towards a design solution without a set of detailed design requirements, which may not be practical or even feasible for management to ascertain for complex, challenging problems. This approach allowed for the possibility of redesigning the original problem statement to better meet the needs of the users. Another lesson learned was to approach problems holistically from the perspective of the needs of individuals that may be affected by advances in topic area instead of purely from a technological feasibility viewpoint. The interdisciplinary nature of the design team also provided valuable experience by allowing team members from different technological backgrounds to work side-by-side instead of dividing into smaller teams, as is frequently done in traditional multidisciplinary design. The team also learned how to work with qualitative data obtained primarily through the 70-plus interviews that were conducted over the course of this project, which was a sharp contrast to using quantitative data with regards to identifying, capturing, analyzing, storing, and recalling the data. When identifying potential interviewees who may have useful contributions to the design subject area, the team found great value in talking to non-traditional users and potential beneficiaries of autonomous aeronautics systems whose impact on the aeronautics autonomy ecosystem is growing swiftly. Finally, the team benefitted from using ""sacrificial prototyping,"" which is a method of rapidly prototyping draft concepts and ideas with the intent of enabling potential users to provide significant feedback early in the design process. This contrasts the more common approach of using expensive prototypes that focus on demonstrating technical feasibility. The unique design approach and lessons learned by the team throughout this process culminated in a final design concept that was quite different than what the team originally assumed would be the design concept initially. A summary of the more usercentered final design concept is also provided.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001317', 'NF1676L-24883', 'AIAA Paper No. 2569919']","['2017 AIAA SciTech Forum; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001317'],['English'],['CASI'],['No Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Aircraft Design, Testing and Performance']","['PROTOTYPES', 'UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS', 'AIRCRAFT DESIGN', 'TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT', 'PILOTLESS AIRCRAFT', 'DESIGN ANALYSIS', 'AUTONOMY', 'RAPID PROTOTYPING', 'LESSONS LEARNED', 'PROBLEM SOLVING', 'QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS', 'TEST STANDS', 'NASA PROGRAMS', 'EXPERIMENT DESIGN', 'FEASIBILITY', 'SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION', 'MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION', 'DEFINITION', 'FEEDBACK']",['Lessons Learned from Applying Design Thinking in a NASA Rapid Design Study in Aeronautics'],['Conference Paper'],Unknown,Unknown,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.08163007182428902,0.09111545387507708,0.0,0.0,0.16826181990214115,0.14827615066509167,0.017446591039018806,0.03899302230698916,0.0,0.0,0.06203359708474276,0.0,0.029122623276173362,0.0,0.082711462779657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07558876420207196,0.6581150036988916,0.0,0.03350749496820045,0.058245246552346724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0573686705805132,0.1430214906552428,0.0,0.0,0.029655230133018334,0.0,0.1703993091344418,0.07389880825823313,0.0,0.1111753601827632,0.0,0.032768594552553945,0.0,0.03142009860829308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414900860549314,0.0939370739608482,0.03429739316418928,0.03350749496820045,0.2523927298532117,0.05716833410274912,0.024832764434472913,0.032768594552553945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818678491839209,0.051919606261358844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056252863042766006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06859478632837857,0.0,0.0,0.03429739316418928,0.03142009860829308,0.07289236310006167,0.44792123700685943,0.0,0.0,0.12616781108818872,0.030801083924267406,0.0,0.2166146048061647,0.0,0.0,0.024138674184665528,0.06203359708474276,0.09933105773789165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023806796374844664,0.07558876420207196,0.032768594552553945,0.0,0.0690416984637718

The experiment investigated the hover performance as a function of the laminar to turbulent transition state of the boundary layer, including both natural and fixed transition cases. The boundary layer transition locations were measured on both the upper and lower aerodynamic surfaces simultaneously. The measurements were enabled by recent advances in infrared sensor sensitivity and stability. The infrared thermography measurement technique was enhanced by a paintable blade surface heater, as well as a new high-sensitivity long wave infrared camera. The measured transition locations showed extensive amounts, x=c>0:90, of laminar flow on the lower surface at moderate to high thrust (CT=s > 0:068) for the full blade radius. The upper surface showed large amounts, x=c > 0:50, of laminar flow at the blade tip for low thrust (CT=s < 0:045).

Temperatures can instead be measured internal to the structure using embedded thermocouples, and direct and inverse methods can then be used to estimate temperature and heat flux on the external surface. Two thermocouples embedded at different depths are required to solve direct and inverse problems, and filtering schemes are used to reduce noise in the measured data. Accuracy in the estimated surface temperature and heat flux is dependent on several factors. Factors include the thermocouple location through the thickness of a material, the sensitivity of the surface solution to the error in the specified location of the embedded thermocouples, and the sensitivity to the error in thermocouple data. The effect of these factors on solution accuracy is studied using the methodology discussed in the work of Pizzo, et. al.1 A numerical study is performed to determine if there is an optimal depth at which to embed one thermocouple through the thickness of a material assuming that a second thermocouple is installed on the back face.

We have tested several of these genetically modified (GM) plums in plant chambers to assess their potential as a space crop. We have been able to clone these genetic lines using cuttings that are rooted using growth regulating compounds. Results showed that the GM plums indeed flower and fruit on small plants in controlled environments similar to what might be used in space, but they require cross-pollination with pollen from a standard plum. Analysis of stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration showed that water use went up in the light period, as expected, and but that GM types typically showed higher conductance than a standard plum. Analysis of tissue showed that fruit could be a good source of potassium and phenolic compounds, which could be beneficial as a bone loss countermeasure (Smith et al., 2014). These findings are all promising for using dwarf GM plums as a supplemental food for space, but further horticultural testing is needed before they are ready.

"['McDermid, Sonali P.', 'Kanter, David R.']",2017-02-06,2016-12-04,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance as well as a key component of the nitrogen cascade. While emissions scenarios indicating the range of N2O's potential future contributions to radiative forcing are widely available, the impact of these emissions scenarios on future stratospheric ozone depletion is less clear. This is because N2O's ozone destructiveness is partially dependent on tropospheric warming, which affects ozone depletion rates in the stratosphere. Consequently, in order to understand the possible range of stratospheric ozone depletion that N2O could cause over the 21st century, it is important to decouple the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and compare different emissions trajectories for individual substances (e.g. business-as-usual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions versus low emissions of N2O). This study is the first to follow such an approach, running a series of experiments using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences ModelE2 atmospheric sub-model. We anticipate our results to show that stratospheric ozone depletion will be highest in a scenario where CO2 emissions reductions are prioritized over N2O reductions, as this would constrain ozone recovery while doing little to limit stratospheric NOx levels (the breakdown product of N2O that destroys stratospheric ozone). This could not only delay the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, but might also prevent a return to pre-1980 global average ozone concentrations, a key goal of the international ozone regime. Accordingly, we think this will highlight the importance of reducing emissions of all major greenhouse gas emissions, including N2O, and not just a singular policy focus on CO2.",['text'],['GSFC-E-DAA-TN38467'],"['International Nitrogen Initiative Conference (INI 2016); 4-8 Dec. 2016; Melbourne; Australia', 'Proceedings of the 2016 International Nitrogen Initiative Conference, ""Solutions to Improve Nitrogen Use Efficiency for the World""']",['20170001308'],['English'],['Other Sources'],['Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Geophysics', 'Environment Pollution']","['EXHAUST GASES', 'CARBON DIOXIDE', 'STRATOSPHERE', 'NITROUS OXIDES', 'GREENHOUSE EFFECT', 'OZONE DEPLETION', 'EXHAUST EMISSION', 'OZONE', 'TROPOSPHERE', 'ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION', 'CLIMATE', 'ATMOSPHERIC MODELS']",['Nitrous Oxides Ozone Destructiveness Under Different Climate Scenarios'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Goddard Space Flight Center'],"['stratospheric ozone depletion', 'emissions scenarios', 'climate change', 'Nitrous oxide', 'climate change', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.9999999999999999,0.4968060394889663,0.0,0.05192564552751771,0.04405050331072335,0.059002985241346395,0.0,0.0,0.058371486320804127,0.048009065187399065,0.0564888232351003,0.12625216809264483,0.0,0.0,0.03347554538037844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047146824119134484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04643727654886277,0.0,0.10609862644238342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689651665442205,0.14356237413880504,0.047146824119134484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041398152003305703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03801885103463261,0.0,0.10849104882876527,0.21402878317628177,0.09255022693410285,0.0,0.10609862644238342,0.8206894071061306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035608337050459155,0.0,0.04267692386960168,0.04553408212791217,0.05192564552751771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08850447786201959,0.26715791409754897,0.0,0.041398152003305703,0.14589569722042237,0.0,0.0,0.1443972107851105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03347554538037844,0.0,0.0,0.10849104882876527,0.048009065187399065,0.0,0.040790397868375974,0.10609862644238342,0.09782676619317052,0.0

To enable s and TB assimilation, GLEAM is coupled to the Water Cloud Model and the L-band Microwave Emission from the Biosphere (L-MEB) model. The innovations, i.e. differences between observations and simulations, are mapped onto the model soil moisture states through an Ensemble Kalman Filter. The validation of surface (0-10 cm) soil moisture simulations over the period 2010-2014 against in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) shows that assimilating s or TB alone improves the average correlation of seasonal anomalies (Ran) from 0.514 to 0.547 and 0.548, respectively. The joint assimilation further improves Ran to 0.559. Associated enhancements in daily evaporative flux simulations by GLEAM are validated based on measurements from 22 FLUXNET stations. Again, the singular assimilation improves Ran from 0.502 to 0.536 and 0.533, respectively for s and TB, whereas the best performance is observed for the joint assimilation (Ran = 0.546). These results demonstrate the complementary value of assimilating radar backscatter observations together with brightness temperatures for improving estimates of hydrological variables, as their joint assimilation outperforms the assimilation of each observation type separately.",['text'],['GSFC-E-DAA-TN38389'],['Remote Sensing of Environment (ISSN 0034-4257); Volume 189; 194-210'],['20170001305'],['English'],['Other Sources'],['Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Earth Resources and Remote Sensing'],"['SATELLITE OBSERVATION', 'BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE', 'SOIL MOISTURE', 'IN SITU MEASUREMENT', 'EVAPORATION', 'MICROWAVE EMISSION', 'ASSIMILATION', 'MICROWAVE RADIOMETERS', 'BACKSCATTERING', 'RADAR TRACKING', 'ANOMALIES', 'ATMOSPHERIC MODELS', 'ESTIMATES']",['Assimilation of Global Radar Backscatter and Radiometer Brightness Temperature Observations to Improve Soil Moisture and Land Evaporation Estimates'],['Journal Article'],['NASA Goddard Space Flight Center'],"['GLEAM', 'SMOS', 'ASCAT', '\n            \n          ']",1.0,0.0,0.46777003484320556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052199850592163685,0.0,0.0,0.2754195438146137,0.0,0.1499267259582522,0.055847549784265885,0.0,0.07436158122426423,0.0,0.0,0.0834214460453859,0.0,0.059231527360837484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654719008386064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12324896212500396,0.409683545774133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135116949188557,0.08467294154749022,0.0,0.0,0.18773058433135723,0.0,0.0,0.09000253981024038,0.29299905291570677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065646578609603,0.054586029260155794,0.1422663816224979,0.09386529216567861,0.0,0.0,0.08654719008386064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06300528240279117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187707799362951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052199850592163685,0.6077679352773002,0.09598186458335635,0.07324976322892669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21899655603844695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12097662095732684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04944230357151168

MIT Lincoln Laboratory is responsible for the cameras, including the lens assemblies, detector assemblies, lens hoods, and camera mounts. TESS is scheduled to be launched in August of 2017 with the primary goal to detect small planets with bright host starts in the solar neighborhood, so that detailed characterizations of the planets and their atmospheres can be performed. The TESS payload consists of four identical cameras and a data handling unit. Each camera consists of a lens assembly with seven optical elements and a detector assembly with four charge-coupled devices (CCDs) including their associated electronics. The optical prescription requires that several of the lenses are in close proximity to a neighboring element. A finite element model (FEM) was developed to estimate the relative deflections between each lens-bezel assembly under launch loads to predict that there are adequate clearances preventing the lenses from making contact. Modal tests using non-contact response measurements were conducted to experimentally estimate the modal parameters of the lens-bezel assembly, and used to validate the initial FEM assumptions.

"['Suddath, Shannon N.', 'Tedder, Sarah A.', 'Schoenholz, Bryan']",2017-02-07,2016-10-18,"This paper describes the study of lateral misalignment tolerance of a symmetric high-rate free-space optical link (FSOL) for use between International Space Station (ISS) payload sites and the main cabin. The link will enable gigabit per second (Gbps) transmission of data, which is up to three orders of magnitude greater than the current capabilities. This application includes 10-20 meter links and requires minimum size, weight, and power (SWaP). The optical power must not present an eye hazard and must be easily integrated into the existing ISS infrastructure. On the ISS, rapid thermal changes and astronaut movement will cause flexure of the structure which will potentially misalign the free space transmit and receive optics 9 cm laterally and 0.2 degrees angularly. If this misalignment is not accounted for, a loss of the link or degradation of link performance will occur. Power measurements were collected to better understand the effect of various system design parameters on lateral misalignment. Parameters that were varied include: the type of small form pluggable (SFP) transceivers, type of fiber, and transmitted power level. A potential solution was identified that can reach the lateral misalignment tolerance (decenter span) required to create an FSOL on the ISS by using 105 m core fibers, a duplex SFP, two channels of light, and two fiber amplifiers.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001300', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN35196']","['AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference; 18-20 Oct. 2016; Cleveland, OH; United States']",['20170001300'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Optics', 'Space Communications, Spacecraft Communications, Command and Tracking']","['DESIGN ANALYSIS', 'MISALIGNMENT', 'TRANSMITTER RECEIVERS', 'FREE-SPACE OPTICAL COMMUNICATION', 'INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION', 'SYSTEMS ENGINEERING', 'SPACECRAFT COMMUNICATION', 'LIGHT AMPLIFIERS', 'DUPLEXERS', 'LOSSES', 'PAYLOADS']",['Study of Lateral Misalignment Tolerance of a Symmetric Free-Space Optical Link for Intra International Space Station Communication'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"['free space', 'lateral misalignment', 'optical communications', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.8181818181818182,0.39401858304297327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10660214666186878,0.0,0.0,0.31638360602547216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06048109233165496,0.0,0.08518132834857593,0.0,0.06048109233165496,0.08837301396296894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279879344467097,0.0,0.07369701648440474,0.0836927564937854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389937127741619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832330560544093,0.0,0.08645922575200281,0.0,0.0,0.09584550078584886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960134500218398,0.3866910740311326,0.1672127744869564,0.07263383662371843,0.0,0.0,0.07160337523439647,0.08837301396296894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23131634842621426,0.08226754767166942,0.0,0.0,0.07593033406945719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09190125871962039,0.10660214666186878,0.48268078342159454,0.0,0.0,0.1581560097219803,0.09009069060724428,0.0,0.11180828450857361,0.18018138121448857,0.08518132834857593,0.0,0.06048109233165496,0.07263383662371843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392659253050497,0.14739403296880949,0.0,0.35349205585187576,0.0

Planning is underway to enhance and transform the infrastructure over the coming decade. Key to the upgrade will be the simultaneous and efficient use of relay transponders to minimize cost and operations while supporting science and exploration spacecraft. Efficient use of transponders necessitates bandwidth efficient communications to best use and maximize data throughput within the allocated spectrum. Experiments conducted with NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed on the International Space Station provides a unique opportunity to evaluate advanced communication techniques, such as bandwidth-efficient modulations, in an operational flight system. Demonstrations of these new techniques in realistic flight conditions provides critical experience and reduces the risk of using these techniques in future missions. Efficient use of spectrum is enabled by using high-order modulations coupled with efficient forward error correction codes. This paper presents a high-rate, bandwidth-efficient waveform operating over the 225 MHz Ka-band service of the TDRS System (TDRSS). The testing explores the application of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), 2/4/8-phase shift keying (PSK) and 16/32- amplitude PSK (APSK) providing over three bits-per-second-per-Hertz (3 b/s/Hz) modulation combined with various LDPC encoding rates to maximize through- put. With a symbol rate of 200 M-band, coded data rates of 1000 Mbps were tested in the laboratory and up to 800 Mbps over the TDRS 225 MHz channel.

For future end-to-end architecture designs, a key challenge is meeting expected application quality of service requirements for multiple simultaneous mission data flows with options to use diverse onboard local data buses, commercial ground networks, and multiple satellite relay constellations in LEO, MEO, GEO, or even deep space relay links. Effectively utilizing a complex network topology requires orchestration and direction that spans the many discrete, individually addressable computer systems, which cause them to act in concert to achieve the overall network goals. The system must be intelligent enough to not only function under nominal conditions, but also adapt to unexpected situations, and reorganize or adapt to perform roles not originally intended for the system or explicitly programmed. This paper describes architecture features of cognitive networking within the future NASA space communications infrastructure, and interacting with the legacy systems and infrastructure in the meantime. The paper begins by discussing the need for increased automation, including inter-system collaboration. This discussion motivates the features of an architecture including cognitive networking for future missions and relays, interoperating with both existing endpoint-based networking models and emerging information-centric models. From this basis, we discuss progress on a proof-of-concept implementation of this architecture as a cognitive networking on-orbit application on the SCaN Testbed attached to the International Space Station.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001295', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN35064']","['Ka and Broadband Communications Conference ; 18-20 Oct. 2016; Cleveland, OH; United States', 'AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference; 18-20 Oct. 2016; Cleveland, OH; United States']",['20170001295'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Space Communications, Spacecraft Communications, Command and Tracking']","['ARCHITECTURE (COMPUTERS)', 'CHANNELS (DATA TRANSMISSION)', 'COMPUTERS', 'SPACE MISSIONS', 'SPACE COMMUNICATION', 'TELEMETRY', 'END-TO-END DATA SYSTEMS', 'LOW EARTH ORBITS', 'DEEP SPACE', 'MISSION PLANNING']",['Architecture for Cognitive Networking within NASAs Future Space Communications Infrastructure'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"['space networks', 'communication networks', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.8181818181818182,0.49448315911730545,0.0,0.0,0.07052070757501881,0.0472291115371346,0.0,0.0,0.2803417583117538,0.0,0.0,0.050529457994899614,0.0,0.0672804878534595,0.053591195769816836,0.0,0.0,0.07052070757501881,0.053591195769816836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2612063430607079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2230251203022308,0.052953052160651236,0.3397078193035346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040673720392008,0.03830497362691718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628640673527662,0.0,0.0,0.17368395259851593,0.0,0.060864600280261846,0.0,0.17368395259851593,0.15574542128430766,0.1481641978885785,0.19307856428928724,0.0,0.0,0.1268928966733559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27328694495773287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018414635603785,0.17777833927110895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0472291115371346,0.3665954248052292,0.0,0.0,0.18685221782935296,0.0,0.0,0.2972138613632603,0.0,0.07547762560948887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08684197629925797,0.0,0.0,0.06530158576517697,0.0,0.0,0.17893660947622284
"['Maul, William A.', 'Hemminger, Joseph A.', 'Melcher, Kevin J.']",2017-02-07,2016-09-13,"A functional fault model (FFM) is an abstract representation of the failure space of a given system. As such, it simulates the propagation of failure effects along paths between the origin of the system failure modes and points within the system capable of observing the failure effects. As a result, FFMs may be used to diagnose the presence of failures in the modeled system. FFMs necessarily contain a significant amount of information about the design, operations, and failure modes and effects. One of the important benefits of FFMs is that they may be qualitative, rather than quantitative and, as a result, may be implemented early in the design process when there is more potential to positively impact the system design. FFMs may therefore be developed and matured throughout the monitored system's design process and may subsequently be used to provide real-time diagnostic assessments that support system operations. This paper provides an overview of a generalized NASA process that is being used to develop and apply FFMs. FFM technology has been evolving for more than 25 years. The FFM development process presented in this paper was refined during NASA's Ares I, Space Launch System, and Ground Systems Development and Operations programs (i.e., from about 2007 to the present). Process refinement took place as new modeling, analysis, and verification tools were created to enhance FFM capabilities. In this paper, standard elements of a model development process (i.e., knowledge acquisition, conceptual design, implementation & verification, and application) are described within the context of FFMs. Further, newer tools and analytical capabilities that may benefit the broader systems engineering process are identified and briefly described. The discussion is intended as a high-level guide for future FFM modelers.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001294', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN35007']","['AIAA SPACE Forum 2016; 13-16 Sep. 2016; Long Beach, CA; United States']",['20170001294'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Launch Vehicles and Launch Operations', 'Computer Programming and Software', 'Quality Assurance and Reliability']","['FAULT DETECTION', 'DESIGN ANALYSIS', 'GROUND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEM', 'FAULT TOLERANCE', 'MODELS', 'FAILURE MODES', 'PROVING', 'SPACECRAFT LAUNCHING', 'SYSTEM FAILURES', 'NASA SPACE PROGRAMS', 'TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT', 'REAL TIME OPERATION', 'GOVERNMENT/INDUSTRY RELATIONS', 'SYSTEMS ENGINEERING']",['Functional Fault Model Development Process to Support Design Analysis and Operational Assessment'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"[' Verification', ' Fault Isolation', 'Fault Detection', 'Design Analysis', 'Systems Engineering', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.7272727272727273,0.5272938443670151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05996394823309113,0.0,0.043371989454375794,0.2570627119190509,0.0,0.05740883886404008,0.1603854966163175,0.0,0.0,0.17010375509414652,0.04971001992376588,0.04791468955800109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23538682264046593,0.05277134212185602,0.16538701243110338,0.0,0.05277134212185602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04719358581047623,0.03361564483431854,0.053913310636483795,0.04627568134715518,0.0,0.044057036277761794,0.09345117391667711,0.12158377433314603,0.04791468955800109,0.36582781840358986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841447812688745,0.056428602963639676,0.0,0.10554268424371203,0.07727610411565308,0.056428602963639676,0.0,0.23728865715604697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12083118080601737,0.0,0.0,0.053913310636483795,0.0,0.4153260639949334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674397890875159,0.0,0.05277134212185602,0.0,0.3416878750784758,0.11285720592727935,0.051694665567090424,0.0,0.0,0.10338933113418085,0.11992789646618227,0.3490830394653635,0.0,0.0,0.08896311262663678,0.0,0.0,0.12578482505739252,0.0,0.0,0.1191441858377764,0.0,0.04085669712721992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039168698741657876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The STRS standard provides a common, consistent framework to develop, qualify, operate and maintain complex, reconfigurable and reprogrammable radio systems. The cFS is a flexible, open architecture that features a plugand- play software executive called the Core Flight Executive (cFE), a reusable library of software components for flight and space missions and an integrated tool suite. Together, STRS and cFS create a development environment that allows for STRS compliant applications to reference the STRS application programmer interfaces (APIs) that use the cFS infrastructure. These APIs are used to standardize the communication protocols on NASAs space SDRs. The cFS-STRS Operating Environment (OE) is a portable cFS library, which adds the ability to run STRS applications on existing cFS platforms. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the cFS-STRS OE prototype, preliminary experimental results performed using the Advanced Space Radio Platform (ASRP), the GRC S band Ground Station and the SCaN (Space Communication and Navigation) Testbed currently flying onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, this paper presents a demonstration of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS) using electronic data sheets (EDS) inside cFE. This configuration allows for the data sheets to specify binary formats for data exchange between STRS applications. The integration of STRS with cFS leverages mission-proven platform functions and mitigates barriers to integration with future missions. This reduces flight software development time and the costs of software-defined radio (SDR) platforms. Furthermore, the combined benefits of STRS standardization with the flexibility of cFS provide an effective, reliable and modular framework to minimize software development efforts for spaceflight missions.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001293', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN34790']","['AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference (ICSSC); 18-20 Oct. 2016; Cleveland, OH; United States']",['20170001293'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Computer Programming and Software', 'Space Communications, Spacecraft Communications, Command and Tracking']","['SYSTEMS INTEGRATION', 'SOFTWARE ENGINEERING', 'RADIO EQUIPMENT', 'FLIGHT CONTROL', 'COMPUTER PROGRAMMING', 'TELECOMMUNICATION', 'SPACE COMMUNICATION', 'DATA SYSTEMS', 'SPACE MISSIONS', 'PROTOTYPES', 'SPACE PLATFORMS']",['Future Standardization of Space Telecommunications Radio System with Core Flight System'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"['space communications', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.8181818181818182,0.5972706155632985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697394330993154,0.0,0.0,0.2571599801782948,0.0,0.037329864919653816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06231266558459197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590400953976208,0.0,0.07169482325581292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156462047167241,0.0,0.0,0.21508446976743878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24072459473989485,0.0,0.1841246280090873,0.0,0.07011382369873777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649497079784297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06722849376056379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049694734241926,0.0,0.0,0.18001198612480634,0.0815473993348974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10475998114165579,0.0,0.07169482325581292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055545289165187535,0.04706256338797971,0.0,0.39483444632072495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11109057833037507,0.1467698819846297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697394330993154,0.5548640346259919,0.0,0.054714803166458784,0.15426107630333355,0.0,0.0,0.21810952790527874,0.0,0.06231266558459197,0.05164868280788087,0.08848742215502799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053911551179181026,0.0,0.0,0.1477261243593075

Compared with the analytical/experimental data of the validation tests, we achieved good agreement. In the steady-state E3 cold flow results using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS), we find a noticeable difference in the flow fields calculated by the two different numerical schemes, the standard Jameson- Schmidt-Turkel (JST) scheme and the AUSM scheme.

Hot-fire testing of a design upgrade of the GR-22 thruster successfully demonstrated resolution of a life-limiting thermo-structural issue encountered during prototype testing on the GPIM program, yielding both an approximately 2x increase in demonstrating life capability, as well as fundamental insights relating to how ionic liquid thrusters operate, thruster scaling, and operational factors affecting catalyst bed life. Further, a number of producibility improvements, related to both materials and processes and promising up to 50% unit cost reduction, have been identified through a comprehensive Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) assessment activity recently completed at Aerojet Rocketdyne. Focused specifically on the GR-1 but applicable to the common-core architecture of both thrusters, ongoing laboratory (heavyweight) thruster testing being conducted under a Space Act Agreement at NASA Glenn Research Center has already validated a number of these proposed manufacturability upgrades, additionally achieving a greater than 40% increase in thruster life.

In particular, a next generation composite impact material model, jointly developed by the FAA and NASA, is being implemented into the commercial transient dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA. The material model, which incorporates plasticity, damage, and failure, utilizes experimentally based tabulated input to define the evolution of plasticity and damage and the initiation of failure as opposed to specifying discrete input parameters (such as modulus and strength). The plasticity portion of the orthotropic, three-dimensional, macroscopic composite constitutive model is based on an extension of the Tsai-Wu composite failure model into a generalized yield function with a non-associative flow rule. For the damage model, a strain equivalent formulation is utilized to allow for the uncoupling of the deformation and damage analyses. In the damage model, a semi-coupled approach is employed where the overall damage in a particular coordinate direction is assumed to be a multiplicative combination of the damage in that direction resulting from the applied loads in the various coordinate directions. Due to the fact that the plasticity and damage models are uncoupled, test procedures and methods to both characterize the damage model and to covert the material stress-strain curves from the true (damaged) stress space to the effective (undamaged) stress space have been developed. A methodology has been developed to input the experimentally determined composite failure surface in a tabulated manner. An analytical approach is then utilized to track how close the current stress state is to the failure surface.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001285', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN33972']","['American Society for Composites Technical Conference; 19-22 Sep. 2016; Williamsburg, VA; United States']",['20170001285'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Composite Materials', 'Structural Mechanics']","['FINITE ELEMENT METHOD', 'PLASTIC PROPERTIES', 'COMPOSITE MATERIALS', 'THREE DIMENSIONAL COMPOSITES', 'STRESS-STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS', 'CRACK INITIATION', 'DAMAGE ASSESSMENT', 'DAMAGE', 'FAILURE', 'MATHEMATICAL MODELS']",['Analysis and Characterization of Damage and Failure Utilizing a Generalized Composite Material Model Suitable for Use in Impact Problems'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"['Finite Element Method', 'Impact', 'Polymer Matrix Composites', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.7272727272727273,0.5211962833914053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056375292116300366,0.059010245309215344,0.0,0.16731575084570444,0.09174197078670959,0.02698654905475225,0.09047215357950457,0.0,0.08030972916955484,0.03198471470302575,0.14020508873511256,0.0,0.04208871774629919,0.0639694294060515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436393347714368,0.5879406781350518,0.0,0.0,0.1488394234444574,0.05182970441840887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436393347714368,0.0,0.04961314114815248,0.044369196233363745,0.06320770573164838,0.0,0.04350622550212654,0.09174197078670959,0.0,0.1537522198079499,0.18289178072102702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04764340267980115,0.0,0.3164359095005151,0.0,0.10365940883681773,0.0,0.03632568461132007,0.0,0.0,0.13013447287999236,0.029476170047430854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08155262110663354,0.0,0.04961314114815248,0.09922628229630497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04860090034216456,0.0,0.0,0.056375292116300366,0.49228725515723254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04764340267980115,0.0,0.2168044886939939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11692140250007478,0.0,0.0,0.026698585102513765

Part of the technology maturation effort included experimental evaluation of the TDU-1 thruster with conducting and dielectric front pole cover materials in two different electrical configurations. A graphite front magnetic pole cover thruster configuration with the thruster body electrically tied to cathode, and an alumina front pole cover thruster configuration with the thruster body floating were evaluated. Both configurations were also evaluated at different facility background pressure conditions to evaluate background pressure effects on thruster operation. Performance characterization tests found that higher thruster performance was attained with the graphite front pole cover configuration with the thruster electrically tied to cathode. A total thrust efficiency of 68% and a total specific impulse of 2,820 s was demonstrated at a discharge voltage of 600 V and a discharge power of 12.5 kW. Thruster stability regimes were characterized with respect to the thruster discharge current oscillations and with maps of the discharge current-voltage-magnetic field (IVB). Analysis of TDU-1 discharge current waveforms found that lower normalized discharge current peak-to-peak and root mean square magnitudes were attained when the thruster was electrically floated with alumina front pole covers. Background pressure effects characterization tests indicated that the thruster performance and stability were mostly invariant to changes in the facility background pressure for vacuum chamber pressure below 110-5 Torr-Xe (for thruster flow rates of 20.5 mg/s). Power spectral density analysis of the discharge current waveforms showed that increasing the vacuum chamber background pressure resulted in a higher discharge current dominant breathing mode frequency. Finally, IVB maps of the TDU-1 thruster indicated that the discharge current became more oscillatory with higher discharge current peak-to-peak and RMS values with increased facility background pressure at lower thruster mass flow rates; thruster operation at higher flow rates resulted in less change to the thruster's IVB characteristics with elevated background pressure.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001283', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN33862']","['AIAA/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference; 25-27 Jul. 2016; Salt Lake City, UT; United States']",['20170001283'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Spacecraft Propulsion and Power'],"['SYSTEMS ENGINEERING', 'ELECTRIC PROPULSION', 'HALL THRUSTERS', 'HALL EFFECT', 'PERFORMANCE TESTS', 'SPECIFIC IMPULSE', 'MAGNETIC SHIELDING', 'PRESSURE EFFECTS', 'ROCKET ENGINES', 'THRUST', 'OSCILLATIONS', 'DIELECTRICS', 'MAGNETIC FIELDS']","[""Performance, Facility Pressure Effects, and Stability Characterization Tests of NASA's Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding Thruster""]",['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"['Electric Propulsion', 'Hall Thrusters', 'Exploration Mission', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.6788617886178862,0.0,0.0,0.02800276533986941,0.018754005356199754,0.0,0.054259170485210215,0.09895085026693098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054442802012214,0.0,0.0,0.031094082607210062,0.0,0.02800276533986941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10345112382933887,0.0,0.2893583941024828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03448370794311295,0.05994217332844086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02894587169186486,0.09902690486224373,0.04428004428398454,0.0,0.0,0.02894587169186486,0.0,0.0,0.07306822965375358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033008968287414585,0.024168463104826808,0.0,0.0,0.1484262754003965,0.019611295310341722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328224782163018,0.0,0.0,0.305104964697291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026716120386457393,0.0,0.09700649108330327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377002678099877,0.20622389052380083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7697589721416945,0.10490611341713665,0.031698447866178744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07666873906788589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12250193785456133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131595126386472

Removal of liquid condensate from the air stream exiting a condenser is readily performed here on Earth. In order to perform this function in space however, without gravity or mechanical action, other tactics including utilization of inertial, drag and capillary forces are required. Within the NC3, liquid water forms via condensation on cold condenser surfaces as humid air passes along multiple spiral channels, each in its own plane, all together forming a stacked plate assembly. Non-mechanical inertial forces are employed to transfer condensate, as it forms, via centripetal action to the outer perimeter of each channel. A V-shaped groove, constructed on this outer edge of the spiral channel, increases local capillary forces thereby retaining the liquid. Air drag then pulls the liquid along to a collection region near the center of the device. Dry air produced by each parallel spiral channel is combined in a common orthogonal, out-of-plane conduit passing down the axial center of the stacked device. Similarly, the parallel condensate streams are combined and removed from the condenser/separator through yet another out-of-plane axial conduit. NC3 is an integration of conventional finned condenser operation, combined with static phase separation and capillary transport phenomena. A Mars' transit mission would be a logical application for this technology where gravity is absent and the use of vibrating, energy-intensive, motor-driven centrifugal separators is undesired. Here a vapor stream from either the Heat Melt Compactor or the Carbon dioxide Reduction Assembly, for example, would be dried to a dew point of 10 deg using a passive NC3 condenser/separator with the precious water condensate recycled to the water bus.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001282', 'GRC-E-DAA-TN33774']",['International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES); 10-14 Jul. 2016; Vienna; Austria'],['20170001282'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics'],"['FABRICATION', 'INERTIA', 'AIR FLOW', 'CENTRIFUGING', 'CONDENSATES', 'MICROGRAVITY', 'WATER RECLAMATION', 'LIQUID AIR', 'GRAVITATION', 'DEW POINT', 'SEPARATORS', 'MARS MISSIONS', 'FINNED BODIES', 'TRANSPORT PROPERTIES']",['Demonstration of Nautilus Centripetal Capillary Condenser Technology'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Glenn Research Center'],"['Separator', 'Two Phase Flow', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.570267131242741,0.0,0.07692529494431188,0.0,0.043705013160405766,0.0,0.0,0.1152993222250495,0.0,0.12552812808406083,0.0935181948074072,0.0,0.0,0.09918475449448731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049592377247243656,0.0,0.14774242140202812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036208163794277,0.0,0.0,0.21738832805274982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137589091426462,0.19600740020233082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13622467853542128,0.17723384179661197,0.0698457056086096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075355813134588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4035476277876733,0.13710861813544417,0.17867160568160703,0.0,0.0,0.0587122596484852,0.0,0.08036208163794277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05275200341286899,0.0,0.06322376780554957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075355813134588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508861717197226,0.0,0.0,0.17290985101131828,0.0,0.0,0.18335775400055862,0.0,0.0698457056086096,0.05789254336382799,0.049592377247243656,0.0,0.40515708386606947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12418866167778392

The three second generation SV-LDI variations are called the 5-recess configuration, the flat dome configuration, and the 9- recess configuration. These three configurations were tested in a NASA Glenn Research Center medium pressure flametube.

All three configurations had low NO(sub x) emissions, with the 5-recess configuration generally having slightly lower NO(x) than the flat dome or 9-recess configurations. Due to the limitations of the flametube that prevented testing at pressures above 20 atm, correlation equations were developed for the at dome and 9-recess configurations so that the landing-takeoff NO(sub x) emissions could be estimated.

This paper will present the development approach used to assess the cathode emitter options. A 2,000-hour wear-test of development model barium-oxide-based (BaO) hollow cathode is being performed as part of the development plan. The cathode was operated with an anode that simulates the HERMeS hall thruster operating environment. Cathode discharge performance has been stable with the device accumulating 740 hours at the time of this report.

This increasing O3 trend combined with the high surface elevation of much of the western US, which aids mixing between boundary layer and free-troposphere, pose challenges in attaining the more stringent O3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) at many western US rural surface sites. As such, the ability to identify various sources and transport mechanisms that contribute towards surface O3 is increasingly important. This paper analyzes vertical profiles of O3 from the Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) over California and Nevada, ozonesondes from Trinidad Head, CA and tropospheric ozone profiles from the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) at the JPL Table Mountain Facility, CA. Surface O3 from the US EPA Clean air Status and Trends Network (CASNET) are used to discuss surface trends. GEOS-Chem determines the trends in regional O3 and assess the contributions of various sources on surface O3. And Realtime Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) is used to forecast and interpret free-tropospheric observations. Specifically we will address the following questions: What are the effects of the lowered NAAQS? Do we observe elevated O3 during 2012 at surface sites reported in previous studies? And if so, what are the causes? How variable is free-tropospheric O3 over California and Nevada? How frequently do we observe high O3 lamina in the free troposphere and what are the surface impacts?",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001278', 'ARC-E-DAA-TN38262']","['2016 AGU Fall Meeting ; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States']",['20170001278'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Environment Pollution', 'Earth Resources and Remote Sensing']","['ENVIRONMENT MODELS', 'REAL TIME OPERATION', 'ANNUAL VARIATIONS', 'OZONE', 'TROPOSPHERE', 'BOUNDARY LAYERS', 'ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION', 'AIR QUALITY', 'INTRUSION', 'FORECASTING', 'ELEVATION']",['Western US Tropospheric Ozone: An Assessment of Vertical and Seasonal Variations over California and Nevada'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Ames Research Center'],"['tropospheric', 'wildfires', 'ozone', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.9999999999999999,0.454123112659698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32582677401514015,0.0,0.15765892049971933,0.08809167633654703,0.14907299334597962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06579281502003549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246160170524382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18463380835944185,0.0,0.06354225334412252,0.0,0.12099155665591668,0.19248008874592828,0.10016976649035977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07748347471043604,0.0,0.14492320341048764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16291338700757008,0.04305090232837454,0.0,0.14805933239033464,0.10411472778622576,0.05530540216899066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246160170524382,0.5796928136419506,0.0586474820326609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04116897125249093,0.45270464944943273,0.0,0.0,0.08143826269347086,0.0,0.0,0.08635908740795147,0.0,0.0,0.10906650203863667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22709689274776634,0.0,0.0,0.05692250011933524,0.0,0.0682580264143748,0.038994149433409765

In this study, we present a new method to detect ozone laminae to understand their climatological characteristics of occurrence frequency in terms of thickness and altitude. We employ both ground-based and airborne ozone lidar measurements and other synergistic observations and modeling to investigate the sources and mechanisms such as biomass burning transport, stratospheric intrusion, lightning-generated NOx, and nocturnal low-level jets that are responsible for depleted or enhanced tropospheric ozone layers. Spaceborne (e.g., OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument), TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution)) measurements of these laminae will observe greater horizontal extent and lower vertical resolution than balloon-borne or lidar measurements will quantify.

"['Kimball, John S.', 'Johnson, Lee F.', 'Maneta, Marco P.']",2017-02-07,2016-12-12,"Water cycle extremes such as droughts and floods present a challenge for water managers and for policy makers responsible for the administration of water supplies in agricultural regions. In addition to the inherent uncertainties associated with forecasting extreme weather events, water planners need to anticipate water demands and water user behavior in a typical circumstances. This requires the use decision support systems capable of simulating agricultural water demand with the latest available data. Unfortunately, managers from local and regional agencies often use different datasets of variable quality, which complicates coordinated action. In previous work we have demonstrated novel methodologies to use satellite-based observational technologies, in conjunction with hydro-economic models and state of the art data assimilation methods, to enable robust regional assessment and prediction of drought impacts on agricultural production, water resources, and land allocation. These methods create an opportunity for new, cost-effective analysis tools to support policy and decision-making over large spatial extents. The methods can be driven with information from existing satellite-derived operational products, such as the Satellite Irrigation Management Support system (SIMS) operational over California, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), and using a modified light-use efficiency algorithm to retrieve crop yield from the synergistic use of MODIS and Landsat imagery. Here we present an integration of this modeling framework in a client-server architecture based on the Hydra platform. Assimilation and processing of resource intensive remote sensing data, as well as hydrologic and other ancillary information occur on the server side. This information is processed and summarized as attributes in water demand nodes that are part of a vector description of the water distribution network. With this architecture, our decision support system becomes a light weight 'app' that connects to the server to retrieve the latest information regarding water demands, land use, yields and hydrologic information required to run different management scenarios. Furthermore, this architecture ensures all agencies and teams involved in water management use the same, up-to-date information in their simulations.

"['Votava, Petr', 'Michaelis, Andrew ', 'Becker, Jeffrey C.', 'Spaulding, Ryan']",2017-02-06,2016-12-12,"NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) is a data, supercomputing and knowledge collaboratory that houses NASA satellite, climate and ancillary data where a focused community can come together to address large-scale challenges in Earth sciences. As NEX has been growing into a petabyte-size platform for analysis, experiments and data production, it has been increasingly important to enable users to easily retrace their steps, identify what datasets were produced by which process chains, and give them ability to readily reproduce their results. This can be a tedious and difficult task even for a small project, but is almost impossible on large processing pipelines. We have developed an initial reproducibility and knowledge capture solution for the NEX, however, if users want to move the code to another system, whether it is their home institution cluster, laptop or the cloud, they have to find, build and install all the required dependencies that would run their code. This can be a very tedious and tricky process and is a big impediment to moving code to data and reproducibility outside the original system. The NEX team has tried to assist users who wanted to move their code into OpenNEX on Amazon cloud by creating custom virtual machines with all the software and dependencies installed, but this, while solving some of the issues, creates a new bottleneck that requires the NEX team to be involved with any new request, updates to virtual machines and general maintenance support. In this presentation, we will describe a solution that integrates NEX and Docker to bridge the gap in code-to-data migration. The core of the solution is saemi-automatic conversion of science codes, tools and services that are already tracked and described in the NEX provenance system, to Docker - an open-source Linux container software. Docker is available on most computer platforms, easy to install and capable of seamlessly creating and/or executing any application packaged in the appropriate format.

"['Haddad, Brent', 'McCullum, Amber Jean Kuss', 'Kidson, Renee']",2017-02-06,2016-12-12,"Inflow projections provide scenarios for future water availability and are integral to operational reservoir management. They can aid water practitioners in decision-making for conservation efforts, multiyear storage retention, managing flood risk, downstream water releases, and regional growth planning. However, conventional methods are often limited in terms of their ability to incorporate non-stationarity, long run persistence, and the cross-correlation of multiple series in a region. This research aims to address these issues with a hybrid approach that integrates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with the Matalas multisite generation method. Multiple long-run inflows were examined for the Shasta/Trinity Reservoirs and Oroville Reservoir of California. EMD is used to decompose each inflow series into a set of independent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that have different timescales and frequencies. These IMFs were grouped into intradecadal (less-than- 10-year average periodicity) and interdecadal (greater-than-10-year average periodicity) series for each site. The IMF projections at each site were then combined to produce replicates of the historical data. This preserves the correlation structure of the intra- and interdecadal components of the series. The hybrid EMD-Matalas method was compared to a traditional autoregressive lag-one model. Both methods were found to retain the statistical characteristics of the historical data. However, the EMD-Matalas method retained the multiyear wet and dry periods to a greater degree. This was examined by comparing the 5-year and 10-year sums from the traditional model with the hybrid EMD-Matalas model. An advantage of the EMD-Matalas method is the ability to explicitly incorporate modes of non-stationary long-run persistence often associated with large-scale climate drivers such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This contributes to scenario planning that may be particularly important for managing multiyear low flow periods.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001274', 'ARC-E-DAA-TN38170']","['AGU Fall Meeting; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States']",['20170001274'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution under U.S. Government purpose rights']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Earth Resources and Remote Sensing'],"['TRANSFORMATIONS (MATHEMATICS)', 'WATER FLOW', 'PERIODIC VARIATIONS', 'WATER MANAGEMENT', 'RESERVOIRS', 'HYDROLOGY MODELS', 'DATA PROCESSING', 'HISTORIES', 'SOUTHERN OSCILLATION', 'EL NINO', 'CLIMATE', 'CALIFORNIA']",['California Reservoir Inflow Projections Using a Hybrid EMD-Matalas Method'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Ames Research Center'],"['inflow projections', 'reservoir management', 'empirical mode decomposition', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.9999999999999999,0.5903019744483159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04006569598021806,0.0,0.0,0.23782127788381321,0.06520065390674151,0.07671693249960587,0.04286546657726252,0.0483593432023534,0.0,0.04546281916062694,0.0,0.0,0.05982456874694759,0.04546281916062694,0.06642879944109764,0.0,0.06642879944109764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079410122871222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06402965252905057,0.0,0.19928639832329292,0.0,0.0,0.07051972434181944,0.1576650568395537,0.04492146517355383,0.07204576672809475,0.0,0.06520065390674151,0.0,0.09366093544872278,0.06499023072494774,0.0,0.08147754656564403,0.0,0.288183066912379,0.13543990748954995,0.0,0.1686673071394026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.264245864315348,0.0,0.0545978726915013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057075805239697866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07051972434181944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381618666175226,0.12019708794065417,0.5183208816182727,0.07367032974972763,0.11244487142626838,0.15851164481241764,0.0,0.0,0.2801492512403348,0.0,0.0,0.05307183030522598,0.0,0.1091957453830026,0.2785647350138952,0.0,0.0,0.2093686252444576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15179662631105062

While marine-sourced aerosols have been shown to make important contributions to surface aerosol loading, cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei concentrations over remote marine and coastal regions, it is still a challenge to differentiate the marine biogenic aerosol signal from the strong influence of continental pollution outflow. We examine here the spatiotemporal variability and quantify the sources of tropospheric aerosols over the North Atlantic during the first two phases (November 2015 and May-June 2016) of NAAMES using a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The model is driven by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). It includes sulfate-nitrate-ammonium aerosol thermodynamics coupled to ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon-aerosol chemistry, mineral dust, sea salt, elemental and organic carbon aerosols, and especially a recently implemented parameterization for the marine primary organic aerosol emission. The simulated aerosols over the North Atlantic are evaluated with available satellite (e.g., MODIS) observations of aerosol optical depths (AOD), and aircraft and ship aerosol measurements. We diagnose transport pathways for continental pollution outflow over the North Atlantic using carbon monoxide, an excellent tracer for anthropogenic pollution transport. We also conduct model perturbation experiments to quantify the relative contributions of terrestrial and oceanic sources to the aerosol loading, AOD, and their variability over the North Atlantic.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001273', 'ARC-E-DAA-TN38154']","['2016 AGU Fall Meeting; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States']",['20170001273'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Earth Resources and Remote Sensing'],"['ATLANTIC OCEAN', 'POLLUTION TRANSPORT', 'HYDROCARBONS', 'AEROSOLS', 'MODIS (RADIOMETRY)', 'MARINE ENVIRONMENTS', 'CARBON MONOXIDE', 'NITROGEN OXIDES', 'OPTICAL THICKNESS', 'MARINE METEOROLOGY', 'ECOSYSTEMS', 'SULFATES', 'CLIMATE']",['A51F-0123: Model Analysis of Tropospheric Aerosol Variability and Sources over the North Atlantic During NAAMES 2015-2016'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Ames Research Center'],"['aerosols', 'plankton ecosystems', 'model analysis', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.9999999999999999,0.5421022067363531,0.07926649056837738,0.0,0.06288650265031423,0.04211633362714751,0.0,0.060925580511577,0.4166556966810457,0.0,0.04032172466940349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0698287502878644,0.0,0.0,0.047789691718946085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07412905641626592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16573465087131828,0.09444126043405296,0.0,0.0,0.06853774595604964,0.0,0.03281822607163962,0.10247482938029927,0.13461362105254743,0.0856477205830741,0.0757332045209506,0.0,0.0,0.07261662535309549,0.17730001702660994,0.07926649056837738,0.0,0.0,0.05427571529629511,0.0,0.0,0.16666227867241828,0.04404157087850135,0.0,0.37866602260475296,0.10651057040146514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059997052258871725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500445990862286,0.0,0.07412905641626592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5448495188235488,0.23232274719701101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20614147163502006,0.07118598829627565,0.0,0.0,0.09557938343789217,0.0,0.0,0.23232274719701101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757332045209506,0.0,0.039891465758813784

Amazon forests are crucial because of their role as the largest carbon sink in the world which would effect the global warming phenomena with decreased photosynthesis activity. Especially, after a decline in plant growth in 1.68 million km2 forest area during the once-in-a-century severe drought in 2010, it is of primary importance to understand the relationship between different climatic variables and vegetation. In an earlier study, we have shown that non-linear models are better at capturing the relation dynamics of vegetation and climate variables such as temperature and precipitation, compared to linear models. In this research, we learn precise models between vegetation and climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) for normal conditions in the Amazon region using genetic programming based symbolic regression. This is done by removing high elevation and drought affected areas and also considering the slope of the region as one of the important factors while building the model. The model learned reveals new and interesting ways historical and current climate variables affect the vegetation at any location. MAIAC data has been used as a vegetation surrogate in our study. For temperature and precipitation, we have used TRMM and MODIS Land Surface Temperature data sets while learning the non-linear regression model. However, to generalize the model to make it independent of the data source, we perform transfer learning where we regress a regularized least squares to learn the parameters of the non-linear model using other data sources such as the precipitation and temperature from the Climatic Research Center (CRU). This new model is very similar in structure and performance compared to the original learned model and verifies the same claims about the nature of dependency between these climate variables and the vegetation in the Amazon region. As a result of this study, we are able to learn, for the very first time how exactly different climate factors influence vegetation at any location in the Amazon rainforests, independent of the specific sources from which the data has been obtained.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001271', 'ARC-E-DAA-TN38163']","['2016 AGU Fall Meeting; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States']",['20170001271'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution under U.S. Government purpose rights']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Earth Resources and Remote Sensing'],"['CLIMATOLOGY', 'LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE', 'REGRESSION ANALYSIS', 'RAIN FORESTS', 'VEGETATION GROWTH', 'GLOBAL WARMING', 'AMAZON REGION (SOUTH AMERICA)', 'MODIS (RADIOMETRY)', 'DROUGHT', 'VEGETATION', 'CLIMATE']",['IN11B-1621: Quantifying How Climate Affects Vegetation in the Amazon Rainforest'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Ames Research Center'],"['global warming', 'climate', 'carbon sink', '\n            \n          ']",0.0,0.9999999999999999,0.6411149825783972,0.0,0.0,0.041530024689688486,0.027813478276897848,0.0,0.0,0.27515795347186034,0.0,0.07988497454037288,0.17854242053817326,0.10071270512618585,0.03962184183583347,0.0,0.09222932111937407,0.1333475412911851,0.0,0.0315601439634283,0.0,0.047010975756487404,0.09222932111937407,0.0,0.0,0.05364229704367459,0.0,0.19228227866394082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889836086079006,0.048954567569285096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06567034755514446,0.06236867550674519,0.05001394132336265,0.08585743239551845,0.1357862575483572,0.040870538300538446,0.2817495306723357,0.06767401612234797,0.08889836086079006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732060480385852,0.0,0.1534251233642091,0.0,0.0,0.10469462195011167,0.0,0.20178249921269756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046114660559687035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07924368367166694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12878614859327767,0.09790913513857019,0.048954567569285096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027813478276897848,0.5577158877292154,0.0511417077880697,0.039029435434083604,0.11003827792738946,0.0,0.0,0.13613510126609535,0.0,0.0,0.07368459043059797,0.0631202879268566,0.0,0.0,0.3068502467284182,0.0,0.0,0.07691291146557631,0.1000278826467253,0.0,0.02634418337880205

Metallized nanotube polymer composites (MNPC) are composed of a lightweight polymer matrix, superstrong nanotubes (NT), and functional nanoparticle inclusions. MNPC is prepared by supercritical fluid infusion of various metal precursors (Au, Pt, Fe, and Ni salts), incorporated simultaneously or sequentially, into a solid NT-polymer composite followed by thermal reduction. The infused metal precursor tends to diffuse toward the nanotube surface preferentially as well as the surfaces of the NT-polymer matrix, and is reduced to form nanometer-scale metal particles or metal coatings. The conductivity of the MNPC increases with the metallization, which provides better shielding capabilities against various EMEs and radiations by reflecting and absorbing EM waves more efficiently.

A growth mechanism based on the vapor liquid-solid mechanism is proposed that accounts for the morphological aspects in the micro- and nano-scales.",['application/pdf'],['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001246'],Unknown,['20170001246'],['English'],['CASI'],['No Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Nonmetallic Materials'],"['VAPOR DEPOSITION', 'FABRICATION', 'COATINGS', 'THIN FILMS', 'DIAMONDS', 'CARBONACEOUS MATERIALS', 'CATALYSTS', 'NANORODS', 'IRON', 'DIAMETERS', 'PATENTS', 'NANOCRYSTALS', 'GRAPHITE', 'SILICON', 'PAPILLAE', 'NANOSTRUCTURE GROWTH', 'MORPHOLOGY', 'SELF ASSEMBLY']",['Diamond-Like Carbon Nanorods and Fabrication Thereof'],['Patent'],['Puerto Rico Univ.'],Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.16260162601626016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16267197307413364,0.0,0.1180689696907885,0.0,0.0,0.1756817249948792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13993646624391393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970599329809301,0.13827015594163353,0.0,0.0,0.40138070066731113,0.0,0.288292291894308,0.10002132947248153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16267197307413364,0.12896132146684333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24404962934986205,0.0,0.2977041777239691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466477889664327,0.5583947028062353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623111580683213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16111135483888722,0.17051444777146402,0.0,0.0,0.0

A methodology is also described for capturing shocks, and simulation results are compared to the finite-volume formulation that is currently the primary method employed for routine engineering applications. The finite-element methodology is demonstrated to be more accurate than the finite-volume technology, particularly on tetrahedral meshes where the solutions obtained using the finite-volume scheme can suffer from adverse effects caused by bias in the grid. Although no effort has been made to date to optimize computational efficiency, the finite-element scheme is competitive with the finite-volume scheme in terms of computer time to reach convergence.

The approach utilizes the full navigation state of the vehicle (position, velocity, and attitude) to recast the vehicle aerodynamic model to be a function solely of the atmospheric state (density, pressure, and winds). Force and moment measurements are based on vehicle sensed accelerations and angular rates. These measurements are combined with an aerodynamic model and a Kalman-Schmidt filter to estimate the atmospheric conditions. The new method is applied to data from the Mars Science Laboratory mission, which landed the Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars in August 2012. The results of the new estimation algorithm are compared with results from a Flush Air Data Sensing algorithm based on onboard pressure measurements on the vehicle forebody. The comparison indicates that the new proposed estimation method provides estimates consistent with the air data measurements, without the use of pressure measurements.

We present aeroelastic uncertainty quantification studies using the SemiSpan Supersonic Transport wind tunnel model at the NASA Langley Research Center. The aeroelastic study team decided treat both structural and aerodynamic input parameters as uncertain and represent them as samples drawn from statistical distributions, propagating them through aeroelastic analysis frameworks. Uncertainty quantification processes require many function evaluations to asses the impact of variations in numerous parameters on the vehicle characteristics, rapidly increasing the computational time requirement relative to that required to assess a system deterministically. The increased computational time is particularly prohibitive if high-fidelity analyses are employed. As a remedy, the Istanbul Technical University team employed an Euler solver in an aeroelastic analysis framework, and implemented reduced order modeling with Polynomial Chaos Expansion and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to perform the uncertainty propagation.

An unstructured sensitivity-enabled Navier-Stokes solver, FUN3D, and a nonlinear flexible multibody dynamics solver, DYMORE, are coupled to predict the aerodynamic loads and structural responses of helicopter rotor blades. A discretely-consistent adjoint-based sensitivity analysis available in FUN3D provides sensitivities arising from unsteady turbulent flows and unstructured dynamic overset meshes, while a complex-variable approach is used to compute DYMORE structural sensitivities with respect to aerodynamic loads. The multidisciplinary sensitivity analysis is conducted through integrating the sensitivity components from each discipline of the coupled system. Numerical results verify accuracy of the FUN3D/DYMORE system by conducting simulations for a benchmark rotorcraft test model and comparing solutions with established analyses and experimental data. Complex-variable implementation of sensitivity analysis of DYMORE and the coupled FUN3D/DYMORE system is verified by comparing with real-valued analysis and sensitivities. Correctness of adjoint formulations for FUN3D/DYMORE interfaces is verified by comparing adjoint-based and complex-variable sensitivities. Finally, sensitivities of the lift and drag functions obtained by complex-variable FUN3D/DYMORE simulations are compared with sensitivities computed by the multidisciplinary sensitivity analysis, which couples adjoint-based flow and grid sensitivities of FUN3D and FUN3D/DYMORE interfaces with complex-variable sensitivities of DYMORE structural responses.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001229', 'NF1676L-24688']","['SciTech Forum; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001229'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Aircraft Design, Testing and Performance', 'Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics', 'Numerical Analysis']","['SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS', 'COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS', 'MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH', 'NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION', 'COMPLEX VARIABLES', 'NONLINEARITY', 'STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS', 'ROTARY WING AIRCRAFT', 'AERODYNAMIC LOADS', 'UNSTRUCTURED GRIDS (MATHEMATICS)', 'AERODYNAMIC DRAG', 'UNSTEADY FLOW', 'LIFT', 'DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATION', 'ADJOINTS', 'ACCURACY', 'TURBULENT FLOW']",['Sensitivity Analysis of Multidisciplinary Rotorcraft Simulations'],['Conference Paper'],Unknown,Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.4973867595818815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040093816790595684,0.08393556380390615,0.4059986225681605,0.34376072887369974,0.06524641612751796,0.07677077762219255,0.0,0.0,0.17134759467945074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22747364018213156,0.0,0.0,0.06647542365732538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055435932004475365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06647542365732538,0.0,0.0,0.07056921984533142,0.0631102867283277,0.08990598818115375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05891589172850403,0.031242224338837526,0.16258961314132248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05626189641423965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2644313299028459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209633331118048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048393285054277084,0.5875489466273431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17134759467945074,0.0,0.0,0.06912941897158978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20747386968247003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08410376366953665,0.0,0.0,0.053109079698750644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055435932004475365,0.07209633331118048,0.0,0.18987895928947296

Two technologies have significant potential for slat noise reduction; the slat-cove filler (SCF) and the slat-gap filler (SGF).

A novel magnetic capture and latching mechanism is analyzed that allows for docking of two CubeSats without precise sensors and actuators. The proposed magnetic docking hardware not only provides the means to latch the CubeSats but it also significantly increases the likelihood of successful docking in the presence of relative attitude and position errors. The simplicity of the design allows it to be implemented on many CubeSat rendezvous missions. A CubeSat 3-DOF ground demonstration effort is on-going at NASA Langley Research Center that enables hardware-in-the loop testing of the autonomous approach and docking of a follower CubeSat to an identical leader CubeSat. The test setup consists of a 3 meter by 4 meter granite table and two nearly frictionless air bearing systems that support the two CubeSats. Four cold-gas on-off thrusters are used to translate the follower towards the leader, while a single reaction wheel is used to control the attitude of each CubeSat. An innovative modified pseudo inverse control allocation scheme was developed to address interactions between control effectors. The docking procedure requires relatively high actuator precision, a novel minimal impulse bit mitigation algorithm was developed to minimize the undesirable deadzone effects of the thrusters. Simulation of the ground demonstration shows that the Guidance, Navigation, and Control system along with the docking subsystem leads to successful docking under 3-sigma dispersions for all key system parameters. Extensive simulation and ground testing will provide sufficient confidence that the proposed docking mechanism along with the choosen suite of sensors and actuators will perform successful docking in the space environment.

"['Lee, Esther', 'Wurster, Kathryn E.']",2017-02-06,2017-01-09,"A typical entry vehicle design depends on the synthesis of many essential subsystems, including thermal protection system (TPS), structures, payload, avionics, and propulsion, among others. The ability to incorporate aerothermodynamic considerations and TPS design into the early design phase is crucial, as both are closely coupled to the vehicle's aerodynamics, shape and mass. In the preliminary design stage, reasonably accurate results with rapid turn-representative entry envelope was explored. Initial results suggest that for Mach numbers ranging from 9-20, a few inviscid solutions could reasonably sup- port surface heating predictions at Mach numbers variation of +/-2, altitudes variation of +/-10 to 20 kft, and angle-of-attack variation of +/- 5. Agreement with Navier-Stokes solutions was generally found to be within 10-15% for Mach number and altitude, and 20% for angle of attack. A smaller angle-of-attack increment than the 5 deg around times for parametric studies and quickly evolving configurations are necessary to steer design decisions. This investigation considers the use of an unstructured 3D inviscid code in conjunction with an integral boundary-layer method; the former providing the flow field solution and the latter the surface heating. Sensitivity studies for Mach number, angle of attack, and altitude, examine the feasibility of using this approach to populate a representative entry flight envelope based on a limited set of inviscid solutions. Each inviscid solution is used to generate surface heating over the nearby trajectory space. A subset of a considered in this study is recommended. Results of the angle-of-attack sensitivity studies show that smaller increments may be needed for better heating predictions. The approach is well suited for application to conceptual multidisciplinary design and analysis studies where transient aeroheating environments are critical for vehicle TPS and thermal design. Concurrent prediction of aeroheating environments, coupled with the use of unstructured methods, is considered enabling for TPS material selection and design in conceptual studies where vehicle mission, shape, and entry strategies evolve rapidly.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001224', 'NF1676L-24715']","['AIAA SciTech 2017; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001224'],['English'],['CASI'],['No Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics'],"['BOUNDARY LAYERS', 'AEROTHERMODYNAMICS', 'DESIGN ANALYSIS', 'AERODYNAMIC HEATING', 'ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY', 'AERODYNAMICS', 'INVISCID FLOW', 'ANGLE OF ATTACK', 'MACH NUMBER', 'THERMAL PROTECTION', 'NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION']",['Inviscid/Boundary-Layer Aeroheating Approach for Integrated Vehicle Design'],['Conference Paper'],Unknown,Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.6321138211382114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336671822870548,0.0,0.053066227676475,0.3145197757686023,0.1193928593144887,0.10536075997871452,0.039246773719702345,0.04427685854008489,0.052257478851295815,0.08324971678732726,0.0,0.0,0.05477419237367303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4607984417379141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060820895427256653,0.0,0.056618934781291,0.06456646538608428,0.25983901602094855,0.04112920538602352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11433880101148845,0.14875942588049634,0.0,0.07459923077087281,0.0,0.06596367962409727,0.062003050780734675,0.06324913676206033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38710126248443355,0.07672048449416308,0.0,0.06596367962409727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328305756202547,0.15359168450166458,0.053066227676475,0.056618934781291,0.0,0.1936993961582528,0.052257478851295815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324913676206033,0.07336671822870548,0.3796514813322363,0.0,0.0,0.10884759608316054,0.0,0.0,0.20519929256070396,0.0,0.11724856789459435,0.04859151856250864,0.04162485839366363,0.0999774656010433,0.0,0.0,0.05969642965724435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.138981989931357

A nominal Mach number of 0.85 was investigated with a total pressure of 125 kPa and total temperature of 280 K. Two-components of velocity were measured along vertical profiles at different locations above, below, and aft of the airfoil at angles of attack of 0 deg, 3.5 deg, and 7deg. Measurements were assessed for their accuracy, precision, dynamic range, spatial resolution, and overall measurement uncertainty in the context of the applied flowfield. Measurement precisions as low as 1 m/s were observed, while overall uncertainties ranged from 4 to 5 percent. Velocity profiles within the wake showed sufficient accuracy, precision, and sensitivity to resolve both the mean and fluctuating velocities and general flow physics such as shear layer growth. Evidence of flow separation is found at high angles of attack.

"['Raju, Ivatury S.', 'Hampton, Roy W.', 'Dawicke, David S.']",2017-02-06,2017-01-09,"AIAA standards S080 and S081 are applicable for certification of metallic pressure vessels (PV) and composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPV), respectively. These standards require damage tolerance analyses with a minimum reliable detectible flaw/crack and demonstration of safe life four times the service life with these cracks at the worst-case location in the PVs and oriented perpendicular to the maximum principal tensile stress. The standards require consideration of semi-elliptical surface cracks in the range of aspect ratios (crack depth a to half of the surface length c, i.e., (a/c) of 0.2 to 1). NASA-STD-5009 provides the minimum reliably detectible standard crack sizes (90/95 probability of detection (POD) for several non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods (eddy current (ET), penetrant (PT), radiography (RT) and ultrasonic (UT)) for the two limits of the aspect ratio range required by the AIAA standards. This paper tries to answer the questions: can the safe life analysis consider only the life for the crack sizes at the two required limits, or endpoints, of the (a/c) range for the NDE method used or does the analysis need to consider values within that range? What would be an appropriate method to interpolate 90/95 POD crack sizes at intermediate (a/c) values? Several procedures to develop combinations of a and c within the specified range are explored. A simple linear relationship between a and c is chosen to compare the effects of seven different approaches to determine combinations of aj and cj that are between the (a/c) endpoints. Two of the seven are selected for evaluation: Approach I, the simple linear relationship, and a more conservative option, Approach III. For each of these two Approaches, the lives are computed for initial semi-elliptic crack configurations in a plate subjected to remote tensile fatigue loading with an R-ratio of 0.1, for an assumed material evaluated using NASGRO (registered 4) version 8.1. These calculations demonstrate that for this loading, using Approach I and the initial detectable crack sizes at the (a/c) endpoints in 5009 specified for the ET and UT NDE methods, the smallest life is not at the two required limits of the (a/c) range, but rather is at an intermediate configuration in the range (a/c) of 0.4 to 0.6. Similar analyses using both Approach I and III with the initial detectable crack size at the (a/c) endpoints in 5009 for PT NDE showed the smallest life may be at an (a/c) endpoint or an intermediate (a/c), depending upon which Approach is used.

Research on attention-related human performance limiting states (AHPLS) such as channelized attention, diverted attention, startle/surprise, and confirmation bias, has been recommended in a Safety Enhancement (SE) entitled ""Training for Attention Management."" To accomplish the detection of such cognitive and psychophysiological states, a broad suite of sensors was implemented to simultaneously measure their physiological markers during a high fidelity flight simulation human subject study. Twenty-four pilot participants were asked to wear the sensors while they performed benchmark tasks and motion-based flight scenarios designed to induce AHPLS. Pattern classification was employed to predict the occurrence of AHPLS during flight simulation also designed to induce those states. Classifier training data were collected during performance of the benchmark tasks. Multimodal classification was performed, using pre-processed electroencephalography, galvanic skin response, electrocardiogram, and respiration signals as input features. A combination of one, some or all modalities were used. Extreme gradient boosting, random forest and two support vector machine classifiers were implemented. The best accuracy for each modality-classifier combination is reported. Results using a select set of features and using the full set of available features are presented. Further, results are presented for training one classifier with the combined features and for training multiple classifiers with features from each modality separately. Using the select set of features and combined training, multistate prediction accuracy averaged 0.64 +/- 0.14 across thirteen participants and was significantly higher than that for the separate training case. These results support the goal of demonstrating simultaneous real-time classification of multiple states using multiple sensing modalities in high fidelity flight simulators. This detection is intended to support and inform training methods under development to mitigate the loss of ASA and thus reduce accidents and incidents.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001220', 'NF1676L-24736']","['AIAA SciTech 2017; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001220'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Air Transportation and Safety', 'Behavioral Sciences']","['EVOKED RESPONSE (PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY)', 'AIRCRAFT SAFETY', 'HUMAN PERFORMANCE', 'PHYSIOLOGY', 'REAL TIME OPERATION', 'COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT', 'PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY', 'FLIGHT SIMULATION', 'EDUCATION', 'DETECTION', 'SAFETY']",['Prediction of Cognitive States During Flight Simulation Using Multimodal Psychophysiological Sensing'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Langley Research Center'],Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.6713124274099884,0.0,0.13768555312111622,0.05840195005747525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3353507818283231,0.0,0.07489261609818601,0.08369226525726997,0.0,0.05571855170738853,0.0,0.0648491332005627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07740185777715726,0.0,0.0,0.0540797175989025,0.0,0.0,0.07191846107508884,0.0,0.20652832968167428,0.1296982664011254,0.0,0.3018443593696632,0.0,0.1539158069705672,0.04385323990669574,0.0,0.06036887187393263,0.0,0.11494908343952058,0.09143369336351154,0.06344477341871103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06610958406112499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38694320980191127,0.040900885158162634,0.05329954399940648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296982664011254,0.14383692215017768,0.1406650598052622,0.0,0.0,0.05571855170738853,0.14162809723523084,0.0,0.0,0.06036887187393263,0.13768555312111622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743819974845879,0.03911294012920186,0.3288969409965854,0.07191846107508884,0.05488547517186422,0.03868556580416389,0.0,0.0,0.24613861211278223,0.06610958406112499,0.0,0.05180979065733347,0.22190860291211328,0.26649771999703237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20438987277702603,0.0,0.0703325299026311,0.0,0.07409346339135574

A substantial portion of these energy savings come from beneficial aerodynamic-propulsion interaction. Previous research has shown the benefits of particular instantiations of distributed propulsion, such as the use of wingtip-mounted cruise propellers and leading edge high-lift propellers. However, these benefits have not been reduced to a generalized design or analysis approach suitable for large-scale design exploration. This paper discusses the rapid, ""design-order"" toolchains developed to investigate the large, complex tradespace of candidate geometries for the X-57. Due to the lack of an appropriate, rigorous set of validation data, the results of these tools were compared to three different computational flow solvers for selected wing and propulsion geometries. The comparisons were conducted using a common input geometry, but otherwise different input grids and, when appropriate, different flow assumptions to bound the comparisons. The results of these studies showed that the X-57 distributed propulsion wing should be able to meet the as-designed performance in cruise flight, while also meeting or exceeding targets for high-lift generation in low-speed flight.

"['Fahringer, Timothy W.', 'Thurow, Brian S.', 'Humphreys, William M., Jr.', 'Bartram, Scott M.']",2017-02-06,2017-01-09,"A series of comparison experiments have been performed using a single-camera plenoptic PIV measurement system to ascertain the systems performance capabilities in terms of suitability for use in NASA ground test facilities. A proof-of-concept demonstration was performed in the Langley Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch 13-inch (33- cm) Subsonic Tunnel to examine the wake of a series of cylinders at a Reynolds number of 2500. Accompanying the plenoptic-PIV measurements were an ensemble of complementary stereo-PIV measurements. The stereo-PIV measurements were used as a truth measurement to assess the ability of the plenoptic-PIV system to capture relevant 3D/3C flow field features in the cylinder wake. Six individual tests were conducted as part of the test campaign using three different cylinder diameters mounted in two orientations in the tunnel test section. This work presents a comparison of measurements with the cylinders mounted horizontally (generating a 2D flow field in the x-y plane). Results show that in general the plenoptic-PIV measurements match those produced by the stereo-PIV system.

It is speculated that spatial smoothing of the vector fields in the stereo-PIV system could account for the observed differences.

A finite element model is developed to assess the effect of circular facesheet-core disbonds on the strength of sandwich specimens subjected to edgewise compressive loads for the purpose of predicting the critical flaw size for a variety of design parameters. Postbuckling analyses are conducted in which an initial imperfection is seeded using results from a linear buckling analysis. Both the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and cohesive elements are considered for modeling disbond growth. Predictions from analyses using the VCCT and analyses using cohesive elements are in good correlation. A series of parametric analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of core thickness and material, facesheet layup, facesheet-core interface properties, and curvature on the criticality of facesheet-core disbonds of various sizes. The results from these analyses provide a basis for determining the critical flaw size for facesheet-core disbonds subjected to edgewise compression loads and, therefore, nondestructive evaluation flaw detection requirements for this configuration.

The DNS results for a nozzle radius to boundary-layer thickness ratio of 5:5 show that the turbulence statistics of the nozzle-wall boundary layer are nearly unaffected by the transverse curvature of the nozzle wall. Before the acoustic waves emanating from different parts of the nozzle surface can interfere with each other and undergo reflections from adjacent portions of the nozzle surface, the rms pressure fluctuation beyond the boundary layer edge increases toward the nozzle axis, apparently due to a focusing effect inside the axisymmetric configuration. Spectral analysis of pressure fluctuations at both the wall and the freestream indicates a similar distribution of energy content for both the nozzle and the flat plate, with the peak of the premultiplied frequency spectrum at a frequency of [(omega)(delta)]/U(sub infinity) approximately 6.0  inside the free stream and at [(omega)(delta)]/U(sub infinity) approximately 2.0 along the wall.

The main challenge is to develop an AFC system that can provide the necessary lift recovery on a simple hinged flap high-lift system while using the limited pneumatic power available on the aircraft. Innovative low-power AFC concepts will be investigated in the flap shoulder region. The AFC concepts being explored include steady blowing and unsteady blowing operating in the spatial and/or temporal domain.

"['Krishnamurthy, Thiagarajan', 'Seshadri, Banavara R.']",2017-02-03,2017-01-09,"The development of multidisciplinary integrated Structural Health Management (SHM) tools will enable accurate detection, and prognosis of damaged aircraft under normal and adverse conditions during flight. As part of the digital twin concept, methodologies are developed by using integrated multiphysics models, sensor information and input data from an in-service vehicle to mirror and predict the life of its corresponding physical twin. SHM tools are necessary for both damage diagnostics and prognostics for continued safe operation of damaged aircraft structures. The adverse conditions include loss of control caused by environmental factors, actuator and sensor faults or failures, and structural damage conditions. A major concern in these structures is the growth of undetected damage/cracks due to fatigue and low velocity foreign object impact that can reach a critical size during flight, resulting in loss of control of the aircraft. To avoid unstable, catastrophic propagation of damage during a flight, load levels must be maintained that are below a reduced load-carrying capacity for continued safe operation of an aircraft. Hence, a capability is needed for accurate real-time predictions of damage size and safe load carrying capacity for structures with complex damage configurations. In the present work, a procedure is developed that uses guided wave responses to interrogate damage. As the guided wave interacts with damage, the signal attenuates in some directions and reflects in others. This results in a difference in signal magnitude as well as phase shifts between signal responses for damaged and undamaged structures. Accurate estimation of damage size, location, and orientation is made by evaluating the cumulative signal responses at various pre-selected sensor locations using a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization procedure. The damage size, location, and orientation is obtained by minimizing the difference between the reference responses and the responses obtained by wave propagation finite element analysis of different representative cracks, geometries, and sizes.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001027', 'NF1676L-24659']","['AIAA SciTech 2017; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001027'],['English'],['CASI'],"['Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright']","[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']",['Avionics and Aircraft Instrumentation'],"['LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY', 'STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING', 'DAMAGE', 'FINITE ELEMENT METHOD', 'CHARACTERIZATION', 'FLIGHT SAFETY', 'POSITION (LOCATION)', 'MATHEMATICAL MODELS', 'WAVE PROPAGATION', 'AIRCRAFT CONTROL', 'SYSTEMS INTEGRATION', 'DAMAGE ASSESSMENT', 'REAL TIME OPERATION', 'CRACK PROPAGATION', 'HAZARDS', 'GENETIC ALGORITHMS']",['Structural Health Management of Damaged Aircraft Structures Using the Digital Twin Concept'],['Conference Paper'],Unknown,Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.6071428571428571,0.22179213154741148,0.0,0.0,0.05892194381981069,0.0,0.042618306520614734,0.29145656135913045,0.0,0.08461685257511502,0.12607875898237117,0.035559428503861255,0.04196878785612987,0.033429566252827315,0.0,0.09416413459986983,0.04398999933125414,0.16714783126413657,0.048846199884040105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11660253359704928,0.0,0.6827775925309101,0.040734371689111676,0.0,0.10370864986118747,0.05417101743151543,0.047082067299934915,0.1555629747917812,0.0,0.056819725697492274,0.13641462129685955,0.0,0.1391204829093831,0.03303149967202087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18365451180798462,0.11947099101631103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05417101743151543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27202612393518844,0.0,0.040146722884811185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035559428503861255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838291572971603,0.26679096898376503,0.0,0.0413412910652773,0.029139061489891743,0.0,0.0,0.08239935954635673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06685913250565463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047943124068090065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048846199884040105,0.055809290645747085

"['Wells, Douglas P.']",2017-02-03,2017-01-09,"NASA's investment and research in aviation has led to new technologies and concepts that make aircraft more efficient and environmentally friendly. One aircraft design operational concept is the reduction of cruise speed to reduce fuel burned during a mission. Although this is not a new idea, it was used by all of the contractors involved in a 2008 NASA sponsored study that solicited concept and technology ideas to reduce environmental impacts for future subsonic passenger transports. NASA is currently improving and building new analysis capabilities to analyze advanced concepts. To test some of these new capabilities, a transonic truss braced wing configuration was used as a test case. This paper examines the effects due to changes in the design cruise speed and other tradeoffs in the design space. The analysis was baselined to the Boeing SUGAR High truss braced wing concept. An optimization was run at five different design cruise Mach numbers. These designs are compared to provide an initial assessment space and the parameters that should be considered when selecting a design cruise speed. A discussion of the design drivers is also included. The results show that the wing weight in the current analysis has more influence on the takeoff gross weight than expected. This effect caused lower than expected wing sweep angle values for higher cruise speed designs.",['application/pdf'],"['http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001025', 'NF1676L-24665']","['AIAA SciTech 2017 ; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States']",['20170001025'],['English'],['CASI'],['No Copyright'],"[' Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available']","['Aircraft Design, Testing and Performance']","['SWEEP ANGLE', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'TRUSSES', 'LIFE CYCLE COSTS', 'AERODYNAMIC CONFIGURATIONS', 'MACH NUMBER', 'WAVE DRAG', 'WINGS', 'INDUCED DRAG', 'TRADEOFFS', 'DRAG REDUCTION', 'TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT']",['Cruise Speed Sensitivity Study for Transonic Truss Braced Wing'],['Conference Paper'],['NASA Langley Research Center'],Unknown,1.0,0.0,0.3948896631823461,0.16315338361267975,0.07628952847291794,0.06471931340341001,0.08668760641928674,0.0,0.18810372209784856,0.20010620864419995,0.0,0.0414968908408853,0.04637264628403692,0.052316022568167114,0.0,0.0491825098464967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0491825098464967,0.0,0.0,0.07186389104158858,0.0796979110668216,0.0,0.08359476451046705,0.0,0.0,0.40834776572132236,0.0,0.0,0.06926845000199863,0.07628952847291794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06822597765494909,0.0,0.07794042905662299,0.13379799594959804,0.0,0.06369158691820806,0.16887352364663524,0.14061524215040588,0.06926845000199863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473301800003206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15257905694583587,0.16757270067892507,0.3263067672253595,0.0796979110668216,0.11434640493954283,0.045325150999631594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05822701892017463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06174565073230839,0.052316022568167114,0.0,0.12540248139856572,0.06689899797479902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473301800003206,0.1494660360000641,0.0,0.1494660360000641,0.1733752128385735,0.3644738605617216,0.0,0.12164491991952918,0.1286105988757541,0.0,0.0,0.24245646991551748,0.0,0.0,0.11482815473172182,0.0,0.23625991179826394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The methodology has been demonstrated with the hybrid stream discrete ordinate (HSDO) radiative transfer (RT) model. The HSDO method calculates the monochromatic radiances using a 4-stream discrete ordinate method, where only a small number of monochromatic radiances are simulated with both 4-stream and a larger N-stream (N  16) discrete ordinate RT algorithm. The accuracy of the obtained channel radiance is comparable to the result from N-stream moderate resolution atmospheric transmission version 5 (MODTRAN5). The root-mean-square errors are usually less than 5x10(exp -4) mW/sq cm/sr/cm. The computational speed is three to four-orders of magnitude faster than the medium speed correlated-k option MODTRAN5.

This dataset was used as input to a radiative transfer model and the single scattering albedo (SSA) at 368 and 332 nm was calculated. Retrievals from a collocated CIMEL sun photometer were used to evaluate the products and study the absorption spectral behavior of retrieved SSA values. The UVMFR SSA, together with synchronous, CIMEL-derived retrievals of SSA at 440 nm, had a mean of 0.90, 0.87 and 0.83, with lowest values (higher absorption) encountered at the shorter wavelengths. In addition, noticeable diurnal variation of the SSA in all wavelengths is shown, with amplitudes up to 0.05. Strong SSA wavelength dependence is revealed for cases of low Angstrom exponents, accompanied by a SSA decrease with decreasing extinction optical depth, suggesting varying influence under different aerosol composition. However, part of this dependence for low aerosol optical depths is masked by the enhanced SSA retrieval uncertainty. Dust and brown carbon UV absorbing properties were also investigated to explain seasonal patterns.
